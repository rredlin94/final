                <blockquote>Waves come crashing to grey sullen shores.
                    Powerful and strong, it breathes and roars.
                    Cascading and caressing each grain of sand,
                    A warm embrace between sea and land.
                    
                    High above, a seagull soars high.
                    Wings of purity it spreads to fly.
                    Battling high against darkened cloud,
                    In a wind that blows fiercely, flying graceful and proud.
                    
                    Beneath, the sand is soft and warm.
                    Sculpted by nature, it's weathered the storm.
                    A passionate battle between calmness and rage,
                    A new chapter's beginning; don't turn the last page.
                    
                    I listen again to the whispering waves,
                    Music of nature calming and brave.
                    Its power unknown, its stillness untamed,
                    Mysterious and magical, a treasure earth claims.
